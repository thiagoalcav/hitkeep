## Prerequisites

The easiest local setup only needs Docker with Docker Compose support. The
Docker dev stack runs Go, Air, Angular, and Mailpit in containers.

| Tool       | Version | Purpose                                  |
|:-----------|:--------|:-----------------------------------------|
| **Docker** | current | Full local development stack with Compose |

If you prefer native development on your host, also install:

| Tool                  | Version        | Purpose                                           |
|:----------------------|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| **Go**                | 1.26+          | Backend compilation and pinned Go tools           |
| **CGo / C toolchain** | system default | Required by DuckDB's Go bindings                  |
| **Node.js + npm**     | 24+ (LTS)      | Angular dashboard and tracker snippet build       |
| **Mailpit**           | latest         | Local SMTP inbox for mail flows                   |

Air is pinned in `go.mod` and runs through `go tool air`; do not install a
separate global Air binary for normal HitKeep development.

### Native macOS

```bash
# Go (via Homebrew or https://go.dev/dl/)
brew install go

# C toolchain (required for CGo / DuckDB)
xcode-select --install

# Node.js (via fnm, nvm, or Homebrew)
brew install fnm
fnm install 24
fnm use 24

# Local SMTP inbox
brew install mailpit
```

### Native Linux (Ubuntu / Debian)

```bash
# Go — download from https://go.dev/dl/ and follow official instructions
# Or via snap:
sudo snap install go --classic

# C toolchain
sudo apt-get install -y gcc g++ make

# Node.js (via fnm or nvm)
curl -fsSL https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash
fnm install 24 && fnm use 24

# Local SMTP inbox
# See https://mailpit.axllent.org/docs/install/
```

## Getting Started

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pascalebeier/hitkeep.git
cd hitkeep
```

**2. Start the full Docker development stack:**

```bash
make dev-docker-seed
```

This starts:

- **Backend:** Go 1.26.3 with Air live reload on `http://localhost:8080`
- **Frontend:** Angular dev server with hot reload on `http://localhost:4200`
- **Mailpit:** local mail UI on `http://localhost:8025`
- **Seed data:** demo user, site, analytics, ecommerce, AI visibility, and chatbot data

Open `http://localhost:4200` and sign in with:

```text
demo@example.com
demo1234
```

If you do not have `make`, use Docker Compose directly:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml run --rm seed
docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml up --build backend frontend mailpit
```

Use `make dev-docker` when you want the same Docker stack without reseeding data.

---

## Development Workflow

### Docker Development

```bash
# Full hot-reload stack
make dev-docker

# Seed demo data, then start the stack
make dev-docker-seed

# Stop containers
make dev-docker-down

# Stop containers and remove dev volumes
make dev-docker-clean
```

The Docker stack keeps Go modules, Go build cache, npm cache, `node_modules`,
and development data in named Docker volumes. Your source tree is bind-mounted,
so changing Go or Angular files triggers the matching live-reload process.

### Native Development

Use native dev if you already have Go, Node.js, npm, a C toolchain, and Mailpit
installed on your host.

```bash
make dev-seed
```

This runs the backend and frontend in parallel on your host. The backend serves
the API on `:8080`, and the Angular dev server proxies `/api/*` and `/ingest`
to the backend.

### Backend Only

```bash
make dev-backend
```

The `.air.toml` configures Air to watch `*.go`, `*.sql`, `*.html`, `*.tpl`, and `*.tmpl` files. It excludes `frontend/`, `public/`, and `node_modules/`.

When you change a Go file, `go tool air` recompiles and restarts in ~1-2 seconds.

### Frontend Only

```bash
make dev-frontend
```

This starts `ng serve` on `http://localhost:4200`. The Angular proxy config forwards API calls to the backend.

### Full Build (Production Artifacts)

```bash
make build
```

This:
1. Runs `npm ci && ng build --configuration production` for the dashboard (output: `frontend/dashboard/dist/`)
2. Minifies the tracker snippet (`src/tracker/index.ts` → `dist/dashboard/browser/hk.js`) via esbuild
3. Copies the dashboard bundle to `public/`
4. Compiles the Go binary with shared HitKeep build tags: `go build -tags "$(./scripts/go-build-tags.sh)" -o hitkeep ./cmd/hitkeep/main.go`

The binary embeds the `public/` directory, so the build order matters.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Go checks
GOFLAGS="$(./scripts/go-build-tags.sh goflags)" go test ./...
GOFLAGS="$(./scripts/go-build-tags.sh goflags)" go test -race ./...
golangci-lint run "$(./scripts/go-build-tags.sh golangci)"
# Angular checks
cd frontend/dashboard && npm run fmt:check
cd frontend/dashboard && npm run lint
cd frontend/dashboard && npm run test -- --watch=false --no-progress

# Seeded end-to-end tests
cd frontend/dashboard && npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
cd frontend/dashboard && npm run e2e
```

Notes:

- `npm run e2e` is the preferred entrypoint for browser end-to-end tests. It runs `ng e2e`, which delegates to the seeded Playwright suite used in CI.
- The e2e launcher builds the dashboard, builds the Go binary, seeds demo data, and starts a disposable local HitKeep instance automatically.
- `npm run test:e2e` is still available as the lower-level Playwright command, but contributor docs and CI standardize on `ng e2e` / `npm run e2e`.

If you are making a change that touches frontend behavior, try to run the relevant browser coverage before opening a PR:

```bash
# Full seeded suite
cd frontend/dashboard && npm run e2e

# Or a focused spec while iterating
cd frontend/dashboard && npm run test:e2e -- e2e/auth.seeded.spec.js --workers=1
```

### Suggested Verification Before a PR

```bash
# Backend
GOFLAGS="$(./scripts/go-build-tags.sh goflags)" go test ./...

# Frontend
cd frontend/dashboard && npm run fmt:check
cd frontend/dashboard && npm run lint
cd frontend/dashboard && npm run test -- --watch=false --no-progress

# Browser coverage for UI changes
cd frontend/dashboard && npm run e2e
```

### Cleanup

```bash
make clean
# Removes: ./hitkeep binary, public/, frontend/*/dist/, frontend/*/node_modules/
```

Keep reusable fixtures, browser test harnesses, and test-only audit scripts under
`tests/`. The `.github/` directory should contain GitHub configuration and
presentation assets only, not build or test implementation files.

## Commit Conventions

chore(deps): update duckdb-go to v2.5.5
docs(api): document /api/events endpoint
```

Breaking changes must include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit body or footer:

```
feat(auth)!: remove legacy password-only login endpoint

BREAKING CHANGE: The /api/login endpoint now requires 2FA if enabled.
