HitKeep is an open source web analytics platform built for people who want a simpler stack than the usual PostgreSQL, Redis, ClickHouse, and reverse-proxy pileup.

- Single binary runtime
- Embedded DuckDB and NSQ with batched ingest writes
- Privacy-first tracking
- Goals, funnels, ecommerce, AI visibility, AI chatbot analytics, email reports, and API clients
- Self-hosted or managed cloud with EU/US region choice

## Why HitKeep

HitKeep is for teams that want product analytics without adopting a full analytics platform stack.

- **Simple to run:** one binary, one data directory, no external database required
- **Efficient write path:** NSQ buffers ingest bursts and DuckDB appender batches smooth out disk-heavy per-row inserts
- **Privacy-first by default:** cookie-less tracking, Do Not Track support, focused data collection
- **Useful out of the box:** traffic analytics with countries/languages audience toggles, top/landing/exit page views, custom events, goals, funnels, ecommerce, UTM attribution, and scheduled email reports
- **Ready for modern discovery:** AI visibility analytics for server-side AI crawler fetches and downstream AI-referred visits, plus on-site AI chatbot analytics built on structured custom events
- **Built for teams:** passkeys, TOTP, site and team permissions, API clients, share links, and audit visibility
- **Flexible deployment:** self-host it yourself or use HitKeep Cloud and still keep the migration path open

## Quick Start

## Development

Prerequisites:

- Go 1.26+
- Node.js 24+
- Make
- A working C toolchain for DuckDB builds

Build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pascalebeier/hitkeep.git
cd hitkeep
make build
./hitkeep
```

For day-to-day development:

```bash
make dev
```

This starts the Go backend with live reload and the Angular dashboard on `http://localhost:4200`.

For a seeded local workspace with demo data:

```bash
make dev-seed
```
