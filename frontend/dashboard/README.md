# Dashboard

HitKeep's dashboard is an Angular 21 application that also builds the lightweight tracking snippet (`hk.js`).

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

From the repo root, `make dev` starts both the Go backend and this dashboard together. `make dev-seed` does the same with seeded demo data.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the dashboard only, run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

To build the production dashboard bundle, optimize translations, rebuild `hk.js`, and sync the result into the Go app's embedded `public/` directory, run:

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

The Scalar API Reference runtime (`vendor/scalar/standalone.js`) is copied into the build output from `node_modules/@scalar/api-reference/dist/browser/standalone.js` via Angular assets configuration, so it always matches the installed npm package version.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests, use:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For the real seeded end-to-end suite, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

This workspace wires `ng e2e` to the Playwright suite that CI uses. The launcher:

- builds the production dashboard bundle
- builds the Go binary
- seeds realistic demo data
- starts a disposable local HitKeep instance
- runs the browser journeys against the real app

If you want to call Playwright directly while iterating on a focused spec, use:

```bash
npm run test:e2e -- e2e/auth.seeded.spec.js --workers=1
```

Deployment smoke tests use the same seeded binary launcher:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:smoke
npm run test:e2e:smoke:subdirectory
```

The subdirectory smoke runs HitKeep with `HITKEEP_E2E_PUBLIC_PATH=/hitkeep` and verifies the dashboard, authenticated route refreshes, app-owned API/resource/static image paths, the API reference iframe, tracker bundles, and ingest preflight under that prefix.

On a fresh machine, install the browser dependency first:

```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```
